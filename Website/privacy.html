If you are a visitor to this website or an OpenAthens user, or if you represent an organization that uses OpenAthens, we want to explain how we respect your privacy. If you have any questions about this privacy notice or about your personal information, then please call +44 (0) 20 3880 2626 or email contact@openathens.net.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ll use the information, as described in our standard privacy notice (at <a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/website/privacy-notice" target="_blank">https://www.jisc.ac.uk/website/privacy-notice</a>), to provide the OpenAthens service you&#x2019;ve requested, as well as to identify problems or ways to make the service better. We&#x2019;ll keep the information until we are told that you are no longer the nominated contact.</p>
<h2 id="how-have-we-got-your-information">How have we got your information?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>You may have given us your personal data yourself.</strong> For example, you may have given us your business card at an event, emailed us requesting information, or filled in an online form so that you could download a report, document, or some other information.</li>
<li><strong>We may have found your contact details at some publicly available source</strong> but in this case, we wouldn&#x2019;t use them without your consent.</li>
<li><strong>The organisation you work for may have given us your personal data</strong> or asked you to give it to us because your role is key to the OpenAthens service or because you need to be an OpenAthens user.</li>
<li><strong>If you visit our websites, we might use cookies and analytical tools to collect anonymous information about your visit.</strong> Cookies are small text files placed on your computer to collect standard internet log and visitor behavior information. Tracking and analyzing visitor activity enables us to improve the website. For further information visit www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org.

<li>Full details of the cookies and local storage used by the operational parts of the service.<h2 id="what-information-do-we-collect">What information do we collect?</h2>
</li>
<li><strong>If you are an OpenAthens user your organization</strong> may have asked us to create an account for you. To do this we only need your name and email address. We encrypt this information so that we don&#x2019;t disclose your identity to the publishers whose resources you need to access unless your organization asks us to do so. If your organization creates your account they will choose what information to collect and what information to disclose to publishers. This OpenAthens Privacy Notice can&#x2019;t address that situation, you need to contact your organization&#x2019;s OpenAthens administrator if you have any questions.</li>
<li><strong>If you are the OpenAthens contact for your organisation or someone who has expressed an interest in OpenAthens,</strong> we only require your name, your role or job title, your department, the name of your organisation and your business contact details (phone numbers and email address).</li>
<li><p><strong>Occasionally we might ask you for other personal information when we run an event or an online survey.</strong> We&#x2019;ll always make it clear why we&#x2019;re collecting that information and how long we&#x2019;ll keep it and of course, it will be up to you whether you want to participate in the event or survey.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-do-with-your-information">What we do with your information</h2>
<p>We only use your information in connection with the OpenAthens service.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>We may contact you with news about OpenAthens</strong> including changes and improvements to service and to tell you about any events or surveys that we&#x2019;ll be running.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>If you&#x2019;re the nominated contact for your organization,</strong> we may also need to use your personal data to process your purchase orders, invoices, and payments and to contact you about the service. This means we might need to share your personal data with some of our suppliers/service providers.</li>
<li><strong>We&#x2019;ll never sell your data.
