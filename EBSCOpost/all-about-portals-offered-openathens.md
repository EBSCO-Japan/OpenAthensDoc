Contact details card
Display your organization’s public contact details that are set in the organization preferences area of OpenAthens.

Text card
Add text, links, images, and embedded videos. Use this card for things like library information or links to resources.

Button card
Admins can add one button in Basic and unlimited buttons with Plus. Use buttons for links to other library applications and more.

Each of the above cards can be added once in MyAthens Basic tier. MyAthens Plus allows multiple text and button cards, and also includes the following features.

List and Curated List of Resources
Include an alphabetical list of all the resources in your catalog. The list allows end-users to conveniently flag resources as favorites. Any resource in the catalog may be added to a curated list. This might be a good way to highlight underutilized or new resources. For the full list and curated list, resources will only be displayed to users if their assigned permission set allows access.

Content Discovery Widget
With the Plus tier, adding one or more search boxes for linking to content discovery services is available. Some of the services included are EBSCO Discovery Service, EBSCO Publication Finder and CORE Discovery for Open Access.

MyAthens is Easy to Configure
Admins can update MyAthens via the main OpenAthens admin area, allowing updates to resource management and portal within one tool. Universal icons allow for straightforward updates to add, update, move and delete cards. A publish button is offered to make changes available to users. A blue asterisk identifies any unpublished changes. Watch a quick video to see how easy it is to update MyAthens.

MyAthens portals display on any size screen. OpenAthens gives your users a simple path to success with a clean and easy portal to view available resources and easily access them with SAML SSO and IP/Proxy.
